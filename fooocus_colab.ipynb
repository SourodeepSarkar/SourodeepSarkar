The older brother’s uniform appears more formal, while the younger brother’s attire is clearly distinct with SHORTER pants. They stand in a natural pose, possibly with the older brother resting a hand on the younger one’s shoulder. The background is minimal or softly blurred, ensuring the focus remains on their distinct outlines. The lighting creates a strong contrast, emphasizing the silhouette effect.
